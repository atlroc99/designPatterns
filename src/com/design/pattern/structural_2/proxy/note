A proxy
    is basically a substitute for an intended object. Access to the original object is not
    always possible due to many factors. For example, it is expensive to create, it is in need
    of being secured, it resides in a remote location, and so forth. The proxy design pattern
    helps us in similar contexts. When a client deals with a proxy object, it assumes that it
    is talking to the actual object. So, in this pattern, you may want to use a class that can
    perform as an interface to something else.
